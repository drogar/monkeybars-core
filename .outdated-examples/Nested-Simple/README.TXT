The Nested-Simple sample shows off using a single nested controller. The search
controller is a nested controller that only knows when its search value has
changed.

This example also shows off registering a callback from a parent controller to
a nested controller.

Built against Monkeybars 6.2.

Rawr is needed to build this project.
