		<h1>Installing Monkeybars</h1>
		Monkeybars is provided in three forms, a gem, a jar file and a zip of the source files.  
		The preferred method of installation is using RubyGems as that provides with it an installer
		script that will set up a basic project structure for you.  The jar file is intended for
		integrating Monkeybars into existing Swing applications.  The source distribution is for 
		anyone who wishes to view and make changes to the source files without expanding the gem
		or jar file and who isn't checking out the latest code from the central source control system.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h1>Using the Monkeybars installer script</h1>
		If using the gems version of Monkeybars, you will also get an installer script that can be
		run from the command line.  When run, this installer script will create a new project and 
		install an empty application skeleton that serves as a starting point for your application.
		This basic structure includes the monkeybar.jar file, a main.rb file that requires in the
		monkeybar.jar file, a Rakefile that imports in the Monkeybars generate tasks and base classes
		for your Controllers and Views.
