The Nested-DropIn sample shows off the nested controller feature using
a payment form that has a billing address and a shipping address (the address
pane is a re-used and nested controller).

This also shows how to spawn and clean up controllers via the multiton methods
on Monkeybars::Controller.

Built against Monkeybars 6.2.

Rawr is needed to build this project.

If viewing this project as a Netbeans project, one can see how a design preview
for fairly static nested views is done.
