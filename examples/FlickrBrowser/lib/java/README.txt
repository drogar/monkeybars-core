Place your jars here.

You'll need current versions of:

* monkeybars
* jruby-complete

These would ordinarily be installed when you generated a project, 
but since this is a given example the jars are omitted to avoid
bloating the source distribution.


You might also need a miglayout jar, but this is an older example that may be using swinglayout
