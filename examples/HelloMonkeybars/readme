This sample application demonstrates the basics of hooking up a form to a
Controller/Model/View triad.  Just a single button and a single text field
exist in the form and activating the button changes the text on the
label on the form.

Run with: jruby src/main.rb

The class files were compiled using Netbeans, thus the existence of a build
directory, if using rawr or another compilation tool you will need to adjust
the classpath in manifest.rb to load that location.
